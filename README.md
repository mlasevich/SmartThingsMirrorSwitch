# SmartThingsMirrorSwitch

My SmartApps and other SmartThings code

## SmartApps

* MirrorSwitch - Link state of one switch to another

* ProxyConditionalSwitch - Create a proxy switch that only turns off the real switch if it was turned on
  via the proxy and ignore it if it is already on. Useful for bypassing automation if light is aready on.

* SmartMotionProxySwitch - Allow motion sensor to control a switch with a conditional proxy.

* BatteryMonitor - Monitor battery level for a device and alert if level falls bellow. Especially useful
  for FirstAlert ZCombo Smoke Detectors which do not have that capability built in
